Create a modern, visually immersive personal portfolio website for a Software Engineer at Philips, specializing in backend engineering (.NET, AWS ecosystem, SQL).

The design should feature:

🧠 Personal Branding
Clean, minimal layout with dark theme (developer aesthetic).

Prominent intro section with my name, role (Software Engineer @ Philips), and a short tagline like: "Building resilient cloud-native backend systems."

Add clearly visible placeholders for my social profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub, Email.

🎮 3D and Three.js Integration
Include a Three.js canvas as a hero background or spotlight section that showcases:

A rotating, glowing 3D wireframe sphere or cube representing a "cloud-based backend".

Floating tech icons or logos (AWS, C#, .NET, Prometheus, Grafana) in orbit using Three.js.

Smooth animations using shaders or particles to make it feel alive and responsive to scroll or mouse.

Optionally, create an interactive Three.js component:

"Tech Stack Constellation" – each star is a tech I use (hover to highlight, click to learn more).

🔥 Animations & Transitions
Smooth page transitions with fade/slide.

Animate skill bars or timeline entries using scroll-triggered effects (GSAP or native CSS).

Use Framer Motion for animated cards showing featured projects.

📁 Portfolio Structure
Hero Section – Name, tagline, 3D canvas

About Me – Bio, skills, short story

Experience – Timeline showcasing Philips & previous roles

Projects – Card layout with thumbnail, tags, and a "View Project" button

Blog / Insights (Optional) – Placeholder for future articles

Contact – Form + social links

🧩 Tech Theme Ideas
Use a sci-fi, cyberpunk, or digital grid inspired theme to match an advanced software engineer identity. Think:

Matrix code background (low opacity)

Digital glitch effects or cursor trails

Light + dark toggle with glowing UI elements

✳️ Ensure everything is responsive and loads fast despite 3D usage. Prioritize WebGL optimization and lazy-load non-critical scripts.

Finally, make sure it feels like a living space – where creativity and code blend.
